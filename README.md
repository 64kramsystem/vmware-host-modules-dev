# VMWare host modules fork

My fork of the latest Workstation branch of the "VMWare host modules" repository, with applied a patch to fix networking spurious disconnects (see HEAD commit), and a script to quickly setup the modules.

The master branch contains the latest Workstation version with the patches. For each patched version, there is a branch named `workstation-$vmware_version-sav`.
